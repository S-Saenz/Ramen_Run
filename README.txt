NOTE:  The first level is overly easy and optionally skippable by 
hitting the human obstacles that come.  After the first day, bird 
obstacles will appear and there’s more to dodge.

The game is relatively simple mechanically.  You are in a car 
driving to the right, and can use the arrow keys to move up and down.  

The goal of the game is to deliver as much ramen as you can, and 
you do that by collecting ingredients.  In the top right of the screen, 
there will be an icon of the food you need to collect and below that, 
however many of that ingredient you have to collect.  Once you do this 
3 times in a row, you complete an order of ramen.  When that happens, 
there will be a person that shows up in the windows of the second floor 
of the buildings.  When you are near them, press up until you hold up a 
bowl of ramen.  Then the order will be completed and you get money.  

The obstacles of the game (the birds and people), will be on the top and 
bottom rows.  To deal with them, have your character reach out to the row 
they are in (i.e, bottom for the person and top for the bird) to shoo them 
away.  If you mess this up 3 times, you wreck your car and the day ends.  

When the day ends, the game doesn’t end however, as you then go to a mechanic 
who automatically takes ¥200 to fix your car up (and you can buy cosmetics here 
as well).  After that, you can press continue to start the next day, going 
until you get hit 3 times again.  This continues until you get hit 3 times, and 
do not have enough money to fix your car.

There is also a difficulty increase in that the more days you play, the more of each 
ingredient you need to collect to complete an order.  This forces the player to 
survive longer in order to get money from orders.
