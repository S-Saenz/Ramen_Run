date completed: 3 May 2020
creative tilt justification:

creative:
The style is very specific and consistent. And the sound and music was almost entirely(except for the car hit sound) 
made and edited by us, including the voice lines, sound effects and music. The recipe system used in the game adds 
a new physics independent look at an infinite runner. 
Also, adding a market scene which redifined the propper flow for our game by adding another phase to play.

technical:
Implementing a system that tracked what you caught in detail and effectively told you what you had to do was 
fairly difficult. I am particularly proud of the slow scroll in after the tutorial. Oerall I think the most 
impressive part of our game is not so much the big implementations but more so the polish.
